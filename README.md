## [1. Autonomous Driving](https://github.com/aamatemanuel/Computer_Vision/tree/main/Autonomous%20Driving)
### Description
This folder contains an overview code of my master's Thesis project at KUL. I'm working along with [Siemens Digital Industries and Software](https://www.sw.siemens.com/en-US/). A general description about my work is related to Trajectory classifications of cars through visual inspection, in two differente domains: 
- _Synthetic domain_. Software [Siemens Prescan](https://plm.sw.siemens.com/en-US/simcenter/autonomous-vehicle-solutions/prescan/).
- _Real domain_. Open source dataset [nuScenes](https://www.nuscenes.org/)

After performing the aforementioned classification problem, some domain adaptations techniques should be tested to try to generalize a network from synthetic to real domain. Due to confidentiality, I'm just sharing some code to analyze and generate patches of the nuScenes dataset. 

### Skills
- Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTM, Temporal Convolutions, Generative Adversarial Networks (PyTorch).
- Classification task for Left and Right turn, through projection of GPS data into pixel domain.
- Pre-processing: Patch generation, data normalization and Data Augmentations (OpenCV).

## [2. Camera Calibration](https://github.com/aamatemanuel/Computer_Vision/tree/main/Camera%20Calibration)
### Description
This is a DIY project, in which I built a low-cost stereo camera. My goal was to learn how the OpenCV methods for camera callibration, undistortion and stereo vision work, so later on I could use this knowledge for different projects. I used as a reference some work done by [LearnOpencv.org](https://learnopencv.com/depth-perception-using-stereo-camera-python-c/) and by the youtuber [Nicola Nielsen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3LOey68Xpg&ab_channel=NicolaiNielsen-ComputerVision%26AI)

## [4. Deep Learning](https://github.com/aamatemanuel/Computer_Vision/tree/main/Deep%20Learning)
### Description
For my Thesis project, I started my journey to learn formally Deep Learning technical skills. So I followed multiple sources of information to learn PyTorch (I choose PyTorch over Tensorflow just because in the website [PapersWithCode](https://paperswithcode.com/trends), most of the paper implementations are using PyTorch). The 2 main sources that I followed were [University of Amsterdam](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial2/Introduction_to_PyTorch.html), [LearnPyTorch.io](https://www.learnpytorch.io/).  
Additionally, I took some MOOC's for Object Oriented Programming, and pandas for data analysis. 
### Skills
- PyTorch: Tensor, CUDA, Multilayer Perceptron, Torchvision, DL Architectures.
- Object Oriented programming.
- Pandas
